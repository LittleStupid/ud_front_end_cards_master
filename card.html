				Domestic dogs inherited complex behaviors, such as bite inhibition,
				from their wolf ancestors, which would have been pack hunters with complex
				body language. These sophisticated forms of social cognition and communication
				may account for their trainability, playfulness, and ability to fit into
				human households and social situations, and these attributes have given
				dogs a relationship with humans that has enabled them to become one of
				the most successful species on the planet today.
